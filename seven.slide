* Hello, again.

Notwithstanding my remarks yesterday, a reason people choose Go is because it lets them write efficient programs.

But it's not just the compiler, the tooling around the language is what gives us our edge.

Agenda: Seven different ways to profile Go programs.

_Note:_ Not all of them are available on every platform.

There's a lot of information in these slides, please keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times.

* №1 time 

* time

The first method of profiling any program is `time`.

`time` is a shell builtin. The format is specified by POSIX.2 (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992).

    % time go fmt std

    real    0m5.812s
    user    0m4.254s
    sys     0m1.130s

GNU come with a `time(1)` command that is signficantly more powerful than the shell builtin.

	% /usr/bin/time go fmt std
	8.07user 1.02system 0:09.25elapsed 98%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 221940maxresident)k
	172296inputs+58448outputs (180major+226861minor)pagefaults 0swaps

BSD also has a `/usr/bin/time`, which is almost as good.
	    
	% /usr/bin/time go fmt std                                                                                                
	4.64 real         3.72 user         0.93 sys

* /usr/bin/time -v (GNU)

GNU's `/usr/bin/time` suports many flags, the most impressive is `-v`.

    % /usr/bin/time -v go fmt std
        Command being timed: "go fmt std"
        User time (seconds): 7.44
        System time (seconds): 0.80
        Percent of CPU this job got: 104%
        Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:07.88
        Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 252864
        Average resident set size (kbytes): 0
        Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 24
        Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 233455
        Voluntary context switches: 23564
        Involuntary context switches: 2146
        Swaps: 0
        File system inputs: 16880
        File system outputs: 0
        Socket messages sent: 0
        Socket messages received: 0
        Signals delivered: 0
        Exit status: 0

* /usr/bin/time -v (BSD)

BSD's `/usr/bin/time` also supports `-v`, but it's less impressive.

    % /usr/bin/time -l go fmt std
            4.66 real         3.73 user         0.90 sys
       9687040  maximum resident set size
             0  average shared memory size
             0  average unshared data size
             0  average unshared stack size
        171362  page reclaims
             4  page faults
             0  swaps
             0  block input operations
             2  block output operations
             0  messages sent
             0  messages received
           159  signals received
         17182  voluntary context switches
          7205  involuntary context switches

* Did you know?

The go tool has the ability to add a prefix to every command it runs.

	% go build -toolexec=... github.com/pkg/profile
	% go test -toolexec=... net/http

`-toolexec` applies to _every_ command executed by the `go` tool.

We use this for: 

- `toolstash`, a tool rsc wrote to check the compiler output is byte for byte identical.
- `android/arm` and `ios/arm` builds that are built on one machine, and run on another.

Further reading:

- go help build

* Why is my build so slow?

Most of you know about `go`build`-x` that shows each command the go tool invokes.

	% go build -x fmt
	WORK=/var/folders/lv/028ssy8n19v56_k2q43kkb5r0000gn/T/go-build339335935
	mkdir -p $WORK/fmt/_obj/
	mkdir -p $WORK/
	cd /Users/dfc/go/src/fmt
	/Users/dfc/go/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64/compile -o $WORK/fmt.a -trimpath $WORK -p fmt -complete -buildid dca2fe01d452d533dcd59bec0c14671498d1e88a -D _/Users/dfc/go/src/fmt -I $WORK -pack ./doc.go ./format.go ./print.go ./scan.go

`-x` output can be copied and pasted into the shell to run commands manually. Buuuut, it's kind of laborious.

Idea: combine `-toolexec` and `/usr/bin/time` to profile the entire build.

DEMO:
	go build -toolexec="/usr/bin/time" cmd/compile/internal/gc

* №2 GODEBUG

* GODEBUG

If `/usr/bin/time` is external, let's turn to something built into every Go program.

The Go runtime collects various statistics during the life of your program.

These stats are always collected, but normally supressed, you can enable their display by setting the `GODEBUG` environment variable.

As a garbage collected language, the performance of Go programs is often determined by their interaction with the garbage collector.

A simple way to obtain a general idea of how hard the garbage collector is working is to enable the output of GC logging.

DEMO: 

	env GODEBUG=gctrace=1 godoc -http=:8080

* Intermission №1

* How does a profiler work?

A profiler runs your program and configures the operating system to interrupt it at regular intervals.

This is done by sending `SIGPROF` to the program being profiled, which suspends and transfers execution to the profiler.

The profiler then grabs the program counter for each executing _thread_ and restarts the program.

Question: Why is the profile per _thread_, not per _goroutine_?

* Profiling do's and don't's

Before you profile, you must have a stable environment to get repeatable results.

- The machine must be idle—don't profile on shared hardware, don't browse the web while waiting for a long benchmark to run.
- Watch out for power saving and thermal scaling.
- Avoid virtual machines and shared cloud hosting; they are too noisy for consistent measurements.
- There is a kernel bug on OS X versions less than El Capitan; upgrade or avoid profiling on OS X.

If you can afford it, buy dedicated performance test hardware. Rack them, disable all the power management and thermal scaling and never update the software on those machines.

For everyone else, have a before and after sample and run them multiple times to get consistent results.

* №3 pprof

* pprof

`pprof` descends from the Google Performance Tools suite.

`pprof` profiling is built into the Go runtime.

It comes in two parts:

- `runtime/pprof` package built into every Go program
- `go`tool`pprof` for investigating profiles.

* CPU profiling

CPU profiling is the most common type of profile.

When CPU profiling is enabled, the runtime will interrupt itself every 10ms and record the stack trace of the currently running goroutines.

Once the profile is saved to disk, we can analyse it to determine the hottest code paths.

The more times a function appears in the profile, the more time that code path is taking as a percentage of the total runtime.

* Memory profiling

Memory profiling records the stack trace when a _heap_ allocation is made.

Memory profiling, like CPU profiling is sample based. By default memory profiling samples 1 in every 1000 allocations. This rate can be changed.

Stack allocations are assumed to be free and are _not_tracked_ in the memory profile.

Because of memory profiling is sample based and because it tracks _allocations_ not _use_, using memory profiling to determine your application's overall memory usage is difficult.

* Block profiling

Block profiling is quite unique.

A block profile is similar to a CPU profile, but it records the amount of time a goroutine spent waiting for a shared resource.

This can be useful for determining _concurrency_ bottlenecks in your application.

Block profiling can show you when a large number of goroutines _could_ make progress, but were _blocked_. Blocking includes:

- Sending or receiving on a unbuffered channel.
- Sending to a full channel, receiving from an empty one.
- Trying to `Lock` a `sync.Mutex` that is locked by another goroutine.

Block profiling is a very specialised tool, it should not be used until you believe you have eliminated all your CPU and memory usage bottlenecks.

* One profile at at time

Profiling is not free.

Profiling has a moderate, but measurable impact on program performance—especially if you increase the memory profile sample rate.

Most tools will not stop you from enabling multiple profiles at once.

If you enable multiple profiles at the same time, they will observe their own interactions and skew your results.

*Do*not*enable*more*than*one*kind*of*profile*at*a*time.*

* Microbenchmarks

The easiest way to profile a _function_ is with the `testing` package.

The testing package has built in support for generating CPU, memory, and block profiles.

`-cpuprofile=$FILE` writes a CPU profile to `$FILE`.
`-memprofile=$FILE`, writes a memory profile to `$FILE`, `-memprofilerate=N` adjusts the profile rate to 1/N.
`-blockprofile=$FILE` writes a block profile to `$FILE`.

Using any of these flags also preserves the binary.

	% go test -run=XXX -bench=IndexByte -cpuprofile=/tmp/c.p bytes
	% go tool pprof bytes.test /tmp/c.p

Note: use `-run=XXX` to disable tests, you only want to profile benchmarks.

* Profiling whole programs

`testing` benchmarks is useful for microbenchmarks, but what if you want to profile a complete application?

To profile an application, you could use the runtime/pprof package, but that is fiddly and low level.

A few years ago I wrote a small package, [[https://github.com/pkg/profile][github.com/pkg/profile]], to make it easier to profile an application.

	import "github.com/pkg/profile"

	func main() {
	        defer profile.Start().Stop()
	        ...
	}

DEMO: Show profiling cmd/godoc with pkg/profile

* №4 /debug/pprof

* /debug/pprof

If your program runs a webserver you can enable debugging over http.

.code seven/net-http-pprof.go

Then use the pprof tool to look at a 30-second CPU profile:

	go tool pprof http://localhost:3999/debug/pprof/profile

Or to look at the heap profile:

	go tool pprof http://localhost:3999/debug/pprof/heap

Or to look at the goroutine blocking profile:

	go tool pprof http://localhost:3999/debug/pprof/block


* Using pprof

Now that I've talked about what pprof can measure, I will talk about how to use pprof to analyse a profile.

pprof should always be invoked with _two_ arguments.

    go tool pprof /path/to/your/binary /path/to/your/profile

The `binary` argument *must* be the binary that produced this profile.

The `profile` argument *must* be the profile generated by this binary.

*Warning*: Because pprof also supports an online mode where it can fetch profiles from a running application over http, the pprof tool can be invoked without the name of your binary ([[https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10863][issue 10863]]):

    go tool pprof /tmp/c.pprof

*Do*not*do*this*or*pprof*will*report*your*profile*is*empty.*

* Using pprof (cont.)

This is a sample cpu profile:

        % go tool pprof $BINARY /tmp/c.p
        Entering interactive mode (type "help" for commands)
        (pprof) top
        Showing top 15 nodes out of 63 (cum >= 4.85s)

             7.66s  3.44% 55.85%      7.66s  3.44%  runtime.cas

             6.26s  2.82% 67.80%     32.09s 14.43%  runtime.entersyscall

Often this output is hard to understand.

* Using pprof (cont.)

A better way to understand your profile is to visualise it.

        % go tool pprof $BINARY /tmp/c.p
        Entering interactive mode (type "help" for commands)
        (pprof) web

Opens a web page with a graphical display of the profile.

I find this method to be superior to the text mode, I strongly recommend you try it.

.link seven/profile.svg

`pprof` supports a non interactive form with flags like `-svg`, `-pdf`, etc. See `go`tool`pprof`-help` for more details.

* Using pprof (cont.)

We can visualise memory profiles in the same way.

    % go build -gcflags='-memprofile=/tmp/m.p'
    % go tool pprof --alloc_objects -svg $(go tool -n compile) /tmp/m.p > alloc_objects.svg
    % go tool pprof --inuse_objects -svg $(go tool -n compile) /tmp/m.p > inuse_objects.svg

The allocation profile reports the location of where every allocation was made.

.link seven/alloc_objects.svg

In use profile reports the location of an allocation that are live at the end of the profile.

.link seven/inuse_objects.svg

Here is a visualisation of a block profile:

    % go test -run=XXX -bench=ClientServer -blockprofile=/tmp/b.p net/http
    % go tool pprof -svg http.test /tmp/b.p > block.svg

* Intermission №2

* Framepointers

.image seven/good-news.jpg

Go 1.7 has been released and along with a new compiler for amd64, the compiler now enables frame pointers by default.

The frame pointer is a register that always points to the top of the current stack frame. 

Framepointers enable tools like `gdb(1)`, and `perf(1)` to understand the Go call stack.

* №5 perf

* perf

If you're a linux user, then `perf(1)` is a great tool for profiling applications. Now we have frame pointers, `perf` can profile Go applications.

"The x-axis shows the stack profile population, sorted alphabetically (it is not the passage of time), and the y-axis shows stack depth. Each rectangle represents a stack frame. The wider a frame is is, the more often it was present in the stacks. The top edge shows what is on-CPU, and beneath it is its ancestry. The colors are usually not significant, picked randomly to differentiate frames."

Flame graphs can consume data from many sources, including `pprof` (and `perf(1)`).

Uber have open sourced a tool call go-torch which automates the process, assuming you have the `/debug/pprof` endpoint, or you can feed it an existing profile.

* №7 go tool trace

* go tool trace

In Go 1.5, Dmitry Vyukov added a new kind of profiling to the runtime; [[https://golang.org/doc/go1.5#trace_command][execution trace profiling]].

Gives insight into dynamic execution of a program.

Captures with nanosecond precision:

- goroutine creation/start/end
- goroutine blocking/unblocking
- network blocking
- system calls
- GC events

Execution traces are essentially undocumented ☹️, see [[https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16526][github/go#16526]]

* go tool trace (cont.)

Generating a profile (with [[https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/25354/][CL 25354]] applied):

	% go build -gcflags=-traceprofile=/tmp/t.p cmd/compile/internal/gc

Viewing the trace:

	% go tool trace /tmp/t.p
	2016/08/13 17:01:04 Parsing trace...
	2016/08/13 17:01:04 Serializing trace...
	2016/08/13 17:01:05 Splitting trace...
	2016/08/13 17:01:06 Opening browser

DEMO:

	go tool trace seven/t.p

Bonus: [[https://github.com/pkg/profile/releases/tag/v1.2.0][`github.com/pkg/profile`]] supports generating trace profiles.

	defer profile.Start(profile.TraceProfile).Stop()

* Conclusion

That's a lot to consume in 30 minutes.

Different tools give you a different perspective on the performance of your application.

Maybe you don't need to know always use every one of these tools, but a working knowledge of most will serve you well.
